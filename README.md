# CircuitSax

The Circuit Sax is a saxophone MIDI controller. It lets you play any software instrument you’d like using saxophone fingerings, allowing you to practice without disturbing others, create music in any DAW, and even perform with it. It’s designed to feel as close to a regular saxophone as possible so that it won’t feel unfamiliar to the player.

### Features

- Breath input to trigger/release notes and control the **Mod Wheel** to map to any synth parameter
- Mechanical key switches with custom keycaps meant to mimic the feel of a saxophone
- MIDI output via USB to a computer or phone

- **MPXV5010GP** - Pressure sensor for breath input
- **Haimu Heartbeat Silent Linear Switches** - Mechanical switches for the keys
- **Arduino Micro** - Microcontroller board for sending MIDI output
